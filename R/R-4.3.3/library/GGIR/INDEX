g.inspectfile           function to inspect accelerometer file for
                        brand, sample frequency and header
g.loadlog               Load and clean sleeplog information
g.part1                 function to load and pre-process acceleration
                        files
g.part2                 function to analyse and summarize pre-processed
                        output from g.part1
g.part3                 Detection of sustained inactivity periods as
                        needed for sleep detection in g.part4.
g.part4                 Labels detected sustained inactivity periods by
                        g.part3 as either part of the Sleep Period Time
                        window or not
g.part5                 Merge output from physical activity and sleep
                        analysis into one report
g.part5.analyseRest     Analyse rest (internal function)
g.part6                 Perform temporal pattern analyses
g.plot5                 Generate user-friendly visual report. The first
                        part of the report summarizes important daily
                        metrics in bar plot format.  The second part of
                        the report shows the raw data and annotations
                        in 24-hr periods. Angle-z is shown with sleep
                        annotations during the SPT (sleep period time)
                        window.  ENMO is shown with daytime inactivity
                        and PA (physical activity) annotations in the
                        lower section of each 24-hr plot. The PA
                        annotations are based on a 10 minute bout
                        metric and 80 of a 10 minute bout of MVPA.
                        Vigorous PA is a short window of time above
                        threshold.vig that is part of a bout of MVPA.
                        Light PA is a short window of time above
                        threshold.lig that is part of a bout of light
                        PA.
